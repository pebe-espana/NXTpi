## NXTpi - a lifelong learning journey

### Mission
How to inject new life into a LEGO robot built on NXT-brick basis, by upgrading its control and communication with a Rasberry Pi as companion.
Benefits:
- simplicity and flexibility of mechanical construction offered by LEGO components for easy prototyping
- the power of LeJos in controlling motion of a proven basic mobile platform
- adding the processing power of a Raspberry Pi to add modern sensors, communication and multi-tasking possibilities
- exploiting availability of powerful Python libraries on a Raspberry Pi
- allowing long-range two-way communication with mobile platform via WiFi intranet from a GUI on a laptop
- ... and in the process learn what such frameworks as ROS are all about!
