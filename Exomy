Case study: How about extending the ESA ExoMy rover with NXT?

Simple example to test methods and ways forward could be to add Compass sensor info to the Exomy.

  Reference to ExoMy: see esa-prl/ExoMy 
  
  Issues to solve and possible solutions:
  1) NXT runs LeJos Java as a flexible programming solution. possible communication to the NXT from other platforms could be
  
    USB - only solution found is if the counterpart (=Pi) runs also LeJos Java environment => but failed miserably in installation of it on a Raspi
    
    Bluetooth - apart from LeJos on Raspi found it possible to learn from NXTpy libraries and Bluez Tutorial how to write a Client server connection to NXT in Python. Disadvantage is the latency introduced by Bluetooth link.
    
    I2C - could be a backup solution, hardware description available "Extreme NXT" book, and a project on controlling Lego sensors with Arduino on web.
    
  2) Linking Python Bluetooth based Client server module with ROS container used to control ExoMy
  
    roslibpy library - allows python code on Raspi host (with the access to Bluetooth and hence the Client server link tested) to couple with the ROS network in a docker container on Exomy
