# a sample file of commands to be passed to pilot
# Author and Maintainer: pebe.espana@posteo.eu
#
# - to start - use the parameters as used by ESA joystick translation to motor commands
# - comment lines are allowed and identified by #
# - currently tested by key_pilot action client to pass only the last line in this file as command
# mode = A,X,C
# vel = velocity in % of 100 possible (find 1-50 range useful in being linear)
# deg = range -180 to 180
# dur = duration in number of cycles for motors to be on (at 20Hz 10 cycles at top speed = 13cm )
# Format of command = pass the 4 parameters in 4 character columns
# mode vel deg dur 
#
# equivalent to rosservice call /autojoy -- A 2 90 10
# characterfield sizes for the command parameters to be passed are marked in next two lines

X    50  0   20   # left turn
