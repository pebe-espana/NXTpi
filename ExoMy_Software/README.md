# ExoMy - Software Repository
This repository contains the software to run Exomy from a docker container in an extended form.

The two main extensions are:

- a link via python environment "mypienv" to NXT via bluetooth
- addition of a pilot to run the ExoMy platform through pre-configured tasks

As regards the use of docker container and ExoMy_Software, see original ESA support wiki:

The [wiki](https://github.com/esa-prl/ExoMy/wiki) explains you how to use it.
